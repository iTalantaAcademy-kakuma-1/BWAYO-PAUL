## iTalanta

<!-- How did iTalanta do in this module? -->

### What can there be more of?
I actually think there should be more of strong internet connectivity in order to access data as soon as possible and to commit and send documents.
Also there should be more of practical coaching and time to get used to our computers.
I also think there could be more of gender equality in terms of renumeration.

### What can there be less of?
Less of mistrust between the facilitators and beneficiaries.
### Suggestions for change?
Prospect for students to spend extra classes time with their computers.
### What material did you study most (from iTalanta or elsewhere?)
The git and github materials.
## What iTalanta material did you study least?
I think on how to create a project since we only tackled the basics.
